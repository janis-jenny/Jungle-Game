## 🎮 How to play

## Characters

The game has 2 main characters:

1. The player, called Gamora, designed to move all over directions.
2. The orcs are moving back and forth in the ground platforms.

The main goal of Gamora is to find the treasure chest to end her adventure and collect as many coins as possible to score higher while avoiding orcs and not falling down from the platforms.

### Game Control

To play the game, the arrow keys highlighted below will be very crucial.

![Arrow Keys](./src/assets/arrow_keys.svg)


- Once the game loads, Fill in your name and then click the "Play" Button
- Please note that a name should be more than 2 characters
- Use arrow keys to control Gamora and escape from orcs and to not fall down.
- Use the up arrow key to do jumps and double jumps
- Collect the coins. The more coins you collect, the higher the score.
